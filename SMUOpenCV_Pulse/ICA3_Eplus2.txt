For thought:

How could you use the code to identify heart rate?
When placing a finger over the camera, we can detect the changes in red intensity of the
finger.  But even more noticeable are the changes in the blue values, which can be easily
watched with the naked eye.  100 points (frames) collected at 30FPS is approximately 
3 seconds, which would be the equivalent of two heartbeats.  Identifying the peaks of the 
red and blue values can indicate when the heart beats.


Could you write code that turns on the torch whenever someone places their finger 
over the camera?
Yes, we can make a determination of color values as we are doing, then toggle the torch
on until the finger is removed.

Each float array created was 100 points long: how many seconds of data is this?
100 points == 100 frames, collected at 30 frames per second, equates to 3.33 seconds --
long enough for 2 heartbeats.
